## Setup ##

1. Checkout the "Exercise-3" branch

## Analyze ##

1. Compare your implementation with [ServiceRouteBuilder](./src/main/java/sample/ServiceRouteBuilder.java) and reflect over differences (if any).
2. Compare your transformation bean with [Translator](./src/main/java/sample/Translator.java) and reflect over differences (if any).
3. Open the [Main](./src/main/java/sample/Translator.java) class and make sure you understand it
   
## Develop ##

1. Run the class
2. Create an integration test that tests the route that is deployed through Main (hint: It is very similar to and less code than [ServiceRouteBuilderTest](./src/main/java/sample/ServiceRouteBuilderTest.java)
3. Confirm that you can run your test with success
4. Make a call to your deployed route from SoapUI or Postman
5. Commit your code
6. Push your changes to your personal "camel.sample"
